What the largest development companies most expect from their developers, as well as knowledge and experience? Is the motivation to acquire more knowledge. 

Especially in this area, which is constantly evolving and the developer who stands out wants to learn more, whenever possible. 

The purpose of this course is to provide a definitive language guide that can be used as a reference for the C# developer, with intermediate and advanced content, presented in practice.
